```

### 2. SOLID Principles Implementation
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Interfaces are open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes are substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on needed interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

### 3. Modern State Management
- Riverpod for compile-safe, performant state management
- Separation of state concerns (auth, products, cart, wishlist)
- Functional programming patterns with Result type
- Reactive UI with selective rebuilding

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
- Hierarchical exception system with specific types
- Centralized error processing with user-friendly messages
- Functional error handling with Result type
- Recovery suggestions and contextual actions

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- Multiple loading animation styles
- Contextual error displays with actions
- Smooth transitions between states
- Accessibility support throughout
- Responsive design with consistent theming

## Usage Examples

### Using Enhanced State Widget
```dart
EnhancedStateWidget(
  state: isLoading ? StateView.loading : hasError ? StateView.error : StateView.content,
  errorInfo: errorInfo,
  onRetry: () => loadData(),
  child: ProductList(),
)
```

### Using Repository Pattern
```dart
final result = await productRepository.getProducts();
result.fold(
  onFailure: (error) => showError(error),
  onSuccess: (products) => displayProducts(products),
);
```

### Using Dependency Injection
```dart
// Setup
DependencyInjection.setup();

// Usage in provider
final repository = DependencyInjection.get<ProductRepository>();
```

### Using Enhanced Error Handling
```dart
try {
  await operation();
} catch (e) {
  final errorInfo = ErrorHandler.instance.handleError(e);
  showContextualError(errorInfo);
}
```
